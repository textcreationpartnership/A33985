            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AT laſt (my worthy Friends) I have found both leiſure and advantage, to teſtifie both to you, and to the World, the great value and reſpect which for more than twenty years (that is, ever ſince I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood any thing of you) I have had, as for very many of your Perſons, ſo for that Occupation wherein you dayly are employed: ſo great (I will aſſure you) that for theſe twenty eight years I have hardly
<pb facs="tcp:42749:6"/> been conſulted by any Friend about the diſpoſal of a Child whom I have not adviſed to your Trade: and, but that in the Education of a Child <hi>Nihil invita Minerva,</hi> the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Child ought to give a principal Conduct, I will aſſure you, next to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſervice of GOD in his Goſpel (from which theſe times de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erred me, unleſs I had had enough to have left them to have enabled them to do it freely) I had devoted my Sons to your Fellowſhip; nor would any thing have more pleaſed me as to any Son of mine, than to have ſeen him fancying one of your Looms. For I have either taken falſe Meaſures (which yet I think I have not) or no Employment which I have in my Eye, hath ſuperiour advantages to you, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with you, to ſerve all the Nobler Ends of Mans Life. Were I ſo be your Orator, I think I have To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks enough by me to perſwade any Perſon that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can commend a Trade to a VViſe-man, but what is to be found in Yours; ſome of thoſe things you will find enlarged upon in the firſt of my <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> in the following Sheets. My thoughts, that it was pity that ſuch a number of Perſons employed in ſo excellent an Employment as you are, ſhould want any Advantages to help you from Looms unto Heaven, is that which your hath engaged me in this Service; a Deſign which for ſome years I have had in my Thought, even ever ſince I ſaw <hi>Mr. Flavel's Navigation</hi> and <hi>Husbandry Spiritualized:</hi> But many of you know, that from my Youth upward, my Hand hath been full of Employments, and my latter
<pb facs="tcp:42749:6"/> years more full than my former. More than forty years of my Life, were ſpent without much care what to Eat or Drink; ſince that time thoſe Cares have alſo been upon me, and made my work ſomething more, than to conſider what Subject next to Preach upon, and how to handle it. Theſe few Sheets by reaſon of this, were taken in hand again and again, and as often laid aſide, at laſt a very few days have finiſhed the greater part of them, (and for ſome of that leiſure you may thank ſome <hi>Informers</hi> too:) It is a noble deſign to inſtruct People how to <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize</hi> every Object, and a nobler Practice for any to do it. Our <hi>Bleſſed LORD</hi> made it his buſineſs to take all Advantages to commend to his Diſciples and Hearers ſpiritual Meditations on earthly Objects: The <hi>ſight of Bread, John 6.</hi> brings forth that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sermon about the <hi>Bread of Life.</hi> His asking of <hi>Water of</hi> the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> gave him an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſcourſe of the <hi>living water, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo drinks ſhall thirſt no more:</hi> And it is more than probable, that his ſight of <hi>a Shepherd with his flock of Sheep,</hi> and of a <hi>Vine,</hi> gave occaſion to thoſe excellent Sermons, <hi>John 10. John 15.</hi> It is the great Diſadvantage of moſt Worldly Employments, that they have a natural tendency to divert the Soul from GOD; upon which account I remember it was, that holy <hi>Mr. Palmer</hi> preferred the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to all the Employments of the World, as lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul directly to the Meditations of GOD, and whoſe Work ly in a Communion with him; whereas
<pb facs="tcp:42749:7"/> all other Employments bent the Soul another way. I know no better way to remedy this Diſadvantage from the nature of your Work, than by ſhewing you, how you may make it an Advantage to you. This is the very buſineſs of theſe few Sheets. <hi>Brethren!</hi> give me leave to tell you all, <hi>That my Hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and Prayer to GOD for you, is that you may be ſaved.</hi> Though I have a juſt regret and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for any Soul, that I ſee like to periſh Eternally; yet methinks, I have a juſter and ſadder regret for any induſtrious Souls. I would not have one of them periſh eternally whom I ſee ſo induſtrious to take pains that they and their Families might live a few years comfortably in this Life. There is a Generation of Men that are too lazy to go to Heaven; or to live here, but upon the Alms and Spoils of others: It had been good for them they had never been Born, and it had been alſo good for the World they never had been Born: for their Lives in it are of no further uſe, than to defile, and to devour, and to diſtrub it. If ſuch Men periſh, let them periſh, we having given them a due Warning. But methinks it pities my Soul to think that a Weaver ſhould eternally periſh. A Weaver whom <hi>I</hi> ſee before four of the Clock in the Morning and after <hi>8, 9, 10,</hi> at night hard at Work, that one ſo patient of <hi>Labour</hi> for the <hi>Bread that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth,</hi> ſo patient of Self-denial in the Sports and Pleaſures which others ſpend their Life in, and all for a few Shillings at the end of the Week; <hi>I</hi> ſay, that ſuch a one, after the long Toyl of his Laborius Life,
<pb facs="tcp:42749:7"/> ſhould at laſt lie down in Hell; this goes very near me: And <hi>I</hi> cannot but ſay ſometimes, Surely we (who are the Lords Miniſters) do not inſtruct theſe Men enough; we do not preſs the thoughts of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon them as we ought to do.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42749:14"/> gregarii,</hi> ordinary Common Souldiers; it is the Great <hi>General</hi> that hath ordered the one, and the other to their Stations, and hath fitted the one and the other for their VVorks. What if GOD will have the Princes, the Nobles, the Judges, to ſit all day on the <hi>Throne of Judgment,</hi> and to imploy themſelves in cutting out right to every Man, whiles he willeth me to ſit in my Loom and imploy my ſelf all the day in throwing the Shuttle; VVe both are influenced by the ſame Spirit. On them Reſts the Spirit of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Judgement;</hi> on me alſo (in my model) the Spirit of Wiſdom, from whence I work the Work of the <hi>Weaver.</hi> As I am influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by GOD to my work as well as thoſe that take up higher Stations, and aſſiſted by GOD in it: So I have alſo an opportunity in it, to ſhew my ſelf ſerviceable to GOD, ſerviceable to my Generation. The Magiſtrates work is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; the Rich Mans work is to Feed; Mine is to Cloth the Naked. I can Pray for a Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Loom, becauſe it works for the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Uſes of Mankind. Do I work in a lower Orb than ſome others do? yet I ſerve no lower Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; I work for no lower End than they do. Let not the <hi>Weaver</hi> ſay then, My Family is poor in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> my Trade is lightly eſteemed of. Fools rate things by appearance, and ſacrifice their Judgements to Vulgar applauſe: Wiſe Men judge according to Reality. Can that Trade be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42749:15"/> contemptible, which the wiſe GOD learneth us, in which the Spirit of GOD aſſiſteth us, and which ſerveth one of the greateſt Uſes of the Sons of Men? If therefore thou beeſt bred no higher than to be a <hi>Weaver,</hi> yet be therewith content. <hi>Paul</hi> had learnt to be ſo in every State. Let thy Mind abide in that Calling to which the LORD hath called you; ſay not, O if I had been a <hi>Merchant,</hi> if I had been a <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, &amp;c.</hi> They both derive from thee; and the <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom,</hi> to work all <hi>manner of Work,</hi> even that <hi>of the VVeaver,</hi> doth far more Viſiblie work in thee, than in the one or the other of them: There is far leſs Wiſdom exerciſed by them, in <hi>proportioning Piece,</hi> in <hi>contriving advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Tranſportations,</hi> than in thy <hi>invention</hi> of thy Stuff, mixing and contriving thy Yarns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Spider</hi> certainlie ſhews us more of GOD than the <hi>Butterfly.</hi> The <hi>Silkworm</hi> is a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Miracle of Divine Wiſdom than any other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. THe <hi>Weaver's Trade,</hi> is of great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, yet not coveous to the Fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> That firſt indeed diſcovered <hi>Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (which makes the Uſefulneſs of this Art) but the Art was not diſcovered as ſoon as <hi>Shame</hi> made a neceſſity of <hi>Clothes.</hi> Our firſt Parents firſt <hi>Sewed Fig-leaves together, and made themſelves Aprons,</hi> Geneſis 3.7. [or ſomething to gird about them] here GOD himſelf was the <hi>Weaver,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were their own <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors.</hi> VVe know not the Dimenſions of the Trees, or Leaves, or Fruits of thoſe fruitfull Places; but (be it what it will) the Protection a Fig-leaf could give muſt neceſſarily be very ordinary, and the Covering very ſcant. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42749:16"/> ſaith no more than that they made Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, covering thoſe Parts which Nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Us to Hide. The Extremities of Cold and Heat, which Sin had now made more Afflictive, and the faſt coming-up of the <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Thiſtles,</hi> to which the Earth (for Mans ſake) was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Condemned, ſoon diſcovered need of better Clothes than Fig-trees could afford. When <hi>Weav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> certainly began, is hard to ſay; but if what ſome would have, one of the Daughters of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> began it, it muſt be by that time the world had beed 1651 Years in Being. Be that as it will, we know within a thouſand Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> were skilled in it. We know that in the Tabernacle were Curtains of fine <hi>twined Linnen, Blue, Purple</hi> and <hi>Scarlet</hi> (which certainly refer to woollen.) We know alſo there were <hi>Curtains of Goats Hair,</hi> Exodus 26.7. Of <hi>Silk</hi> indeed we read nothing, that I remember, till <hi>Proverbs</hi> 31. It ſhould ſeem by ſome of the <hi>Roman Hiſtorians,</hi> that it was a rare Commodity 284 Years after our Saviour: <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> therefore the Emperour would wear no Clothes, whoſe <hi>VVarp</hi> and <hi>VVoof</hi> were both Silk; for (ſaith my Author) a Pound of Silk was then of the ſame Value with a Pound of Gold. It was 555 Years after Chriſt before any great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Silk was diſcovered in <hi>Europe. Procopius</hi> tells us, we were then beholden to two <hi>Monks</hi> for it, who brought ſome Silk-worms Eggs from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42749:17"/> the <hi>Indies</hi> to <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour. The Uſe of the other Materials was much more Ancient. <hi>Hemp, Flax</hi> and <hi>Cotton-wool,</hi> are <hi>vegetables: VVooll, Silk and Hair</hi> are the Product of <hi>ſenſitive</hi> Creatures. The whole Creation is made up of Things that have a <hi>meer Being;</hi> ſuch are the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, Stars, &amp;c.</hi> or ſuch things as have Life and no more added to <hi>Being;</hi> ſuch are all <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, Plants, &amp;c.</hi> or ſuch as to <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> have alſo <hi>Senſe</hi> added, and therefore are called <hi>Senſitives;</hi> ſuch are all Beaſts, whether thoſe that have <hi>four feet</hi> or more, ſuch are <hi>Sheep, Goats, Worms, Flies</hi> and all Infects: or ſuch as have <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Life</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo; ſuch is Man. The Angels are a noble part of the Creation too, and have <hi>Being, Life, and Reaſon,</hi> but not <hi>ſenſe</hi> in that <hi>manner</hi> as Man, who exerciſeth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of his Soul by bodily Organs which they want. Two of thoſe great Hoſts of GOD contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and prove little enough to cover Man's <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</hi> The Hoſt of <hi>Vegetables</hi> afford <hi>Hemp, Flax</hi> and <hi>Cotton;</hi> the <hi>ſenſitives Wooll, Hair</hi> and <hi>Flax.</hi> Both would hide Mans ſhame. Man hath Eaten of the Tree of forbidden Fruit, and lieth <hi>Naked in his Tent.</hi> The Devils Mock him in his Lapſed Eſtate: The <hi>Senſitives</hi> and <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables</hi> join together to bring him wherewith to cover his ſhame. The <hi>poor VVorm</hi> ſpins her ſelf to Death; For him the <hi>Sheep</hi> caſts her Coat; The <hi>Goats</hi> and <hi>Camels</hi> ſuffer themſelves to be Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42749:17"/> The <hi>Tree</hi> ſends out <hi>Cotton-VVooll;</hi> The <hi>Plants</hi> grow and die. How doth the whole Creation freely ſerve him, who can hardly find an Heart to ſerve his or their Maker?</p>

That thoſe which meerly have <hi>Being,</hi> are at his Command, or under his Feet, is <hi>plain:</hi> He treadeth upon the Earth, he lets in, or keeps out the Air; He turns the Water this or that way, as ſerveth his concern; He lets in, or keeps out the Air. But ſee alſo the <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Senſitives</hi> ſerving him. The <hi>Sheep before the ſhearers is dumb.</hi> Other Beaſts are patiently ſpoiled of their <hi>Hair.</hi> The <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax</hi> are pilled. The <hi>Cotton-tree</hi> is content to loſe its iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue every Year that Man might be Clothed. The <hi>Ox,</hi> the <hi>Sheep,</hi> and either of their Off-ſpring dyes that He might be Fed: So do the feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Fowl</hi> and <hi>Fiſh.</hi> At what a Rate to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Creation doth Man Live? When tempting our Saviour they brought to Him a Queſtion, <hi>Is it lawfull to pay Tribute to Caeſar, or is it not?</hi> He calls for a Piece of Coin, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth whoſe <hi>Superſcription and Image</hi> it <hi>bare:</hi> they ſay unto him <hi>Caeſar's.</hi> Mark our LORDS Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: <hi>Render therefore unto Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſar's,</hi> and <hi>unto GOD the things that are GODS.</hi> Doth the <hi>Weavers</hi> Diſpute whether he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42749:18"/> ſhould pay his Homage to GOD yea or no? Let him look upon the Parcel of <hi>Hair, Wooll, Silk, Hemp, Flax, Cotton,</hi> which being firſt twiſted into Yarn, he by and by faſtneth to his Loom, and ſay <hi>whoſe Image and Superſcription is here?</hi> his own Heart muſt make him anſwer, GODS. It is not in the Power of all the Sons of Man to make one of theſe things; and out of theſe he gets his Livelihood, and in the uſe of theſe things He and Thouſands of others Live. How reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a thing is it that he ſhould ſerve that great LORD, who makes thus his whole Creation to ſerve him! It is his <hi>Wooll,</hi> his <hi>Hair,</hi> his <hi>Flax,</hi> his <hi>Hemp,</hi> his <hi>Silk,</hi> that the <hi>Weaver</hi> uſeth: VVere there not a GOD in the world there could have been no ſuch things. Surely then he ſhould not Live <hi>without a GOD in the World.</hi> If there be a GOD that loadeth us with his <hi>Benefits,</hi> there is a GOD to receive our <hi>Homages;</hi> with what a thankfull Heart ſhould the <hi>Weaver</hi> faſten his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to his Loom? with what fear ſhould he walk leſt he ſhould provoke GOD to recover at his Hand his <hi>VVooll, and his Flax, which he hath given us to Cover our Nakedneſs?</hi> Hoſea 2.9.</p>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>The whole Creation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Romans</hi> 8.22.) <hi>groaneth and travelleth in Pain untill</hi> now, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. it was made <hi>ſubject to Vanity,</hi> not <hi>willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame in hope. Becauſe it ſhall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption into the Glorious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42749:18"/> of the Sons of GOD. P. Martyr</hi> ſaith the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſubjected to a Four-fold Vanity. 1. As for Mans Service it is <hi>wearied with a dayly Labour.</hi> 2. As it is <hi>puniſhed for Mans Error.</hi> 3. As it <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers together with Man.</hi> 4. As it is made ſubject to <hi>Mans Lust.</hi> GOD hath put it in the three firſt mentioned Subjections, and in them acts <hi>Effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as to the laſt he acteth but <hi>Permiſſively.</hi> The <hi>Silkworm</hi> ſpinneth, and dyeth for us in compaſs of a few weeks ſpace; there's its Vanity: The Plant grows up and dyes and rots for us, to make us Threeds for our Nakedneſs: The Beaſt parts with its own Covering for us; there's a part of their Vanity. They have to none of theſe a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Propenſion, but GOD hath ſubjected them in hope; and they are patiently ſubject; The <hi>Sheep before the Shearer openeth not its Mouth.</hi> But Man hath made it ſubject to a greater Vanity than any of theſe. GOD created theſe Things and ſubjected them to ſerve our Neceſſities; tis Man, ſinfull Man, that hath made them to lacquey his Luſts and Corruptions. The <hi>Silkworm</hi> never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed the ſpinning of its Life for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Pride, and hindrance of good VVorks. The <hi>Sheep</hi> never yielded its Wooll to Cover the Nakedneſs of the Earth, but the Nakedneſs of Man. This is one way by which we make even GOD himſelf to <hi>ſerve</hi> with our Iniquities. This is one thing which makes the Creation groan for the <hi>day of Judgement;</hi> Romans 8.22. becauſe <hi>it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42749:19"/> ſhall then be delivered from this Bondage of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. But yet methinks the difference of the <hi>Weavers Materials</hi> ſpeaks ſome order, which is GODS will: amongſt Men <hi>Wooll</hi> is Coarſer than <hi>Silk, Hair</hi> is a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt them both; <hi>Hemp</hi> is Groſſer than <hi>Flax,</hi> and <hi>Cotton</hi> again is betwixt them both. Our Saviour, <hi>Matthew</hi> 11.8. allows a <hi>ſoft Rayment,</hi> to them that are <hi>in Kings Houſes.</hi> There are ſome whom GOD himſelf Covers with <hi>Silk and fine Linnen</hi> and <hi>Broidered Work, Ezekiel</hi> 16.13. GOD doth no more will a <hi>levelling</hi> for Clothes, than Orders of perſons or Eſtates. The <hi>Silk-worm</hi> is GODS Creature as well as the <hi>Goat, Sheep, Camel, Badger, &amp;c.</hi> and created for Man's uſe. The virtuous Woman may cover her ſelf with <hi>Silk and Purple, Proverbs</hi> 31.20, 22. Theſe things may be upon our Backs, ſo they be not in our Hearts; and certainly the Heart of Man is too noble a thing to receive what a poor Worm hath Vomited out from her Intrails. <hi>Mind not high Things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle); let others (if they pleaſe) by our Silk, know the Station which GOD hath willed us to take up in the world above them; but let us ſtill remember we are but Duſt and Aſhes, and that our Silks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move us from our Neighbours, but ſome few ſteps as to external Order: They are the ſame Fleſh and Blood with us, and have Souls of the ſame <hi>ſpecies</hi> equally ordained to an Eternity,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42749:19"/> and equally capable of a bleſſed Eternity. Silk is lawfull; but it muſt be uſed lawfully. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dorcas</hi> ever wore any, or no, I cannot tell; but whoever wear it will be concerned, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may, like her Executrices, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.39. be able to ſhew the <hi>Coats and Garments</hi> which they have made for the Poor. If ſilken Garments eat up our Ability for Charity; The <hi>Silk-worm</hi> groans for it, and is by it put in Bondage to Corruption. And certainly ſome order is to be obſerved alſo: GOD had never provided us <hi>Wooll</hi> and <hi>Hair</hi> as well as <hi>Silk; Cotton</hi> and <hi>Hemp</hi> as well as <hi>Flax,</hi> if he had not intended ſome difference in our Habits according to our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As it is an ugly ſight to ſee <hi>Princes</hi> go on Foot, and <hi>Servants Riding on Horſe-back;</hi> ſo 'tis no very comely Spectacle to ſee the Servant ride cheek by jole with his Maſter. Let not <hi>Coſtly Garments</hi> devour our good works; And GOD hath not forbidden them. It is Noted of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>France,</hi> that he could never be perſwaded to wear Silk-ſtockens, though then in Uſe in his Nation. Let us not nouriſh High Opinions of our Selves; let them be uſed to ſhew the Difference which the Providence of GOD hath made amongſt Men, as to the place he wills they ſhould take up in the world, and they may be worn innocently. But the <hi>Weaver</hi> is not concerned here; he may weave it, let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers take heed how they uſe it.</p>

Men wind off this Silk thus made, and weave it into a Web, and of this are made the moſt Coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Ornamental Garments; <hi>Who hath deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the day of ſmall things?</hi> How great is GOD in the little Things of Nature?

THe <hi>Weaver</hi> is like to Solomon's Vertuous VVoman, who <hi>Eateth not the Bread of Idleneſs, Proverbs</hi> 31.27. his hands are <hi>not idle,</hi> and therefore his Houſe in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>will not drop through,</hi> Eccleſiaſticus 10.18. <hi>In the Sweat of thy Face thou ſhalt eat thy Bread;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we Miſ-call it when we call it <hi>The firſt Curſe.</hi> The Earth indeed was Curſed for Mans ſake, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. But whether Man in his lapſed Eſtate was <hi>Curſed</hi> or <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> by having a Law of Labour laid upon him, I much queſtion; had it been a Law of Idleneſs, it had been a moſt certain Curſe; for the lapſed Soul of Man, being aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from GOD, had it not been ſet to work, would doubtleſs have worſe imployed it ſelf. If I would ſet a Man into the Road to Hell, I would (as to many (ah wofull!) Parents) breed him up to have nothing to do. Our weaver's Soul hath no leiſure to reſt, he is always buying, or ſcowring, or ſorting, or mixing, or prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Loom, or working in it; poſſibly Men may deſpiſe it as a low Employment, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly better than Drinking, and Gaming, and working Iniquity with Greedineſs: He is not at leiſure to be amongſt the <hi>ſimple Ones,</hi> nor doth his Imployment direct him to the <hi>youth that are without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> and if Solomon's <hi>virtuous Woman</hi> was not degraded, but deſcribed by her

What a pitifull thing vain proud Man is in Power? that cannot give a Being to the leaſt Thing in Nature? hath he think we a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make <hi>all things become New,</hi> that cannot make one thing New? can he make the <hi>New Creature,</hi> by his own Power, that is not able to create the moſt minute Creature? can he make himſelf <hi>a Rohe of Righteouſneſs,</hi> wherein to <hi>ſtand before GOD,</hi> that cannot give a Being to a lock of wooll? Surely as to a ſtate of Righteouſneſs, or any habits of Grace, he muſt alſo, before he can work any thing which will be acceptable in GODS ſight, go to him who hath himſelf rang the Market-bell; Iſaiah 55.2. <hi>Come buy,</hi> and

How cheap is the <hi>Grace of GOD that bringeth Salvation? without Money</hi> and <hi>without Price</hi> (So runs the <hi>Proclamation.</hi>) It is the <hi>gift of the HOLY GHOST,</hi> and the Apoſtle hath taught us; that nothing of that Nature can be Bought with <hi>Simon-Magus</hi> his Money. It were ill called a Gift if it muſt be purchaſed; I cannot Buy a pack of Wooll, nor a Bail of Silk, nor a little Hemp, or Flax, or Hair, without Money: but I may buy CHRIST, his Grace, his Glory <hi>without Money,</hi> and without <hi>Price.</hi> There is no going to the Market without Money, but I may go to CHRIST, I may have Heaven without parting with any thing unleſs what is better parted with than kept. I find by experience that my Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for my Trade are bought too dear; I work them out and loſe by it, I labour for nothing, and ſpend my Money, and my Strength in vain; but did ever any ſay, he had <hi>ſerved GOD in vain,</hi> and <hi>waited upon him for nothing?</hi> CHRIST will exchange his Grace for my Luſts, his Glory for my vile Affections: Surely the dear price of my VVare, ſhould Inhance the ſtudy of Heaven, and heavenly Things in my Soul.

Some of our <hi>Weavers</hi> Pieces will be acceptable in the Native Colour of the Wooll, but it is not ſo with the beſt of our Duties and Actions. GOD hath ſaid to us, <hi>Bring your Brother Benjamin, or ſee my Face no more;</hi> we can onely offer up <hi>ſpiritual ſacrifices acceptable in the Beloved,</hi> 1 Peter 2.5. though our ſacrifices be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> yet they are not acceptable in the Beloved. We have not onely need of an <hi>Advocat</hi> with the Father <hi>if we ſin,</hi> but alſo <hi>if we pray,</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe we cannot pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinning: There's but one Dye for all our Rags, all our web muſt be dipt in the Blood of the Lamb, Revelation 7.14. <hi>They have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb;</hi> and if you obſerve it, they <hi>were thoſe that had come out of great Tribulation.</hi> One would have thought that if any Actions that we had done, could Merit; or might appear as they come from us before the Juſt GOD, what we do in Teſtimony for the Truths and Name of CHRIST might; but if you obſerve theſe were they whom Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw having <hi>waſhed their Robes,</hi> and made them <hi>white in the Blood of the Lamb.</hi> Nothing paſſeth for a Garment in Heaven,

Methinks I cannot but reflect, what twiſting there muſt be too in the Chriſtians Trade. 1. There muſt be a <hi>Twiſting</hi> in every good <hi>and ſpiritual Action;</hi> 1. A <hi>true Principal.</hi> 2. A <hi>right Manner of Performance:</hi> 3. A <hi>true End</hi> muſt be all twiſted together; or the Action is but <hi>ſplendidum peccatum,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was wont to call the <hi>Moral Actions</hi> of Heathens. The End muſt be the Glory of GOD, The Principle muſt be <hi>Love to GOD,</hi> For the Manner it muſt be done in <hi>Faith.</hi> Where theſe three are twiſted together the Action is truly good and ſpiritual. <hi>Secondly,</hi> There muſt be a <hi>twiſting</hi> of good Actions too. It is not enough to begin well, but we muſt go on well and end well; <hi>Connectere ultima pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> make our firſt and laſt things agree, twiſt an Holy Old Age with an Holy Youth. <hi>If a Man forſaketh his Righteouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, his Righteouſneſs ſhall never be remembred.</hi> If any ſoul draweth back, GOD will have no pleaſure in him, he draweth back at his own Peril, and to his own Deſtruction. He that hath twiſted GODS Glory, Love to GOD, and Faith in GOD as to every Action, and thus twiſted the Actions of his Life from the time he begins to ſet out for GOD, will make himſelf a ſtrong Cord (like
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42749:28"/> Solomons triple Cord) of Hope which will not be eaſily broken. <hi>Lastly,</hi> what is twiſting <hi>but an uniting of ſeveral Threeds into one</hi> and is done for ſtrength? <hi>We being many,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are one Bread and one Body.</hi> One Body; there's a twiſting of ſouls, and all Yarns will twiſt: or may twiſt at leaſt. There are indeed ſome he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous things of another kind will never twiſt with them. We are all but as the <hi>LORDS Yarn</hi> made of his <hi>Fleece,</hi> who was <hi>led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter,</hi> died in his Blood. He intends us all for a <hi>One Body.</hi> Why ſhould not we alſo twiſt together both in Truth and Love, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame things, ſpeaking the ſame things, however being <hi>kindly affectioned one to another in Love.</hi> Alas! that we muſt have <hi>a Mill</hi> to force us together, that the Violence of a Perſecution muſt do that which the Love of <hi>CHRIST</hi> in us cannot do. We are ſilly Sheep that will not run together till the Shepherds Dog be after us. Surely there is more in a joint Union with CHRIST to Unite us (would our ſilly Paſſions let us ſee it) than there can be in twenty little particular ſentiments to divide us.</p>

The Chriſtians active Righteouſneſs is alſo a Garment of Divers Colours, his Duty made up of Various Duties; and he never makes his web, True or Beautifull if he doth not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſe his Duties of ſeveral Colours: <hi>Giving to GOD the things that are GODS,</hi> and to <hi>Caeſar the things that are Caeſars,</hi> rightly ordering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his or her Duty to Husband, Wife, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Maſter, Parents, Children, Political Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers; Or to GOD, if he doth not mix his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with Praiſes, his Reading with Hearing the Word Preached, and all with Receiving the Lords Supper.

Now to make his Piece well, 'tis neceſſary the <hi>Warp be firſt laid</hi> and be ſound and good, and the woof muſt bear a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to it too.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42749:33"/> whether any thing be Truth which they have read or heard: and indeed no better is the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of any who by the mighty working of the Spirit of GOD have not Faith wrought in them: hence it is that their Faith is neither Fruitfull by <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good Works,</hi> nor ſteady in it ſelf. There is no need at all that (to ſecure Holineſs of Life) Men ſhould bring it into the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith; and ſo make an innovation in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which alwayes according to the Scripture diſtinguiſhed <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love;</hi> for <hi>Holineſs</hi> (which is Love in the Fruit) is a neceſſary conſequent of true Faith, either reſpecting the <hi>Propoſition of the</hi> Word, or the <hi>Perſon of the Mediator.</hi> Can he be thought indeed to believe that <hi>Arſenick</hi> is Poyſon, who yet freely takes it into his Belly? Or can any be judged to truſt in a Friend for a kindneſs who hath promiſed it, but upon the condition of ſome performance which he refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to do? It is I ſay from this, that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of truth are not faſtned in the Soul, that Men walk not according to the light of them: Epheſians 4.14. and that <hi>they are toſſed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine, by the sleight of Men, and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> Every breath of wind would diſturb the <hi>Weaver,</hi> and every idle hand would trouble him if his warp were not faſtned to his Loom. Every wind of Doctrine, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ignorant idle Seducer diſturbeth that Souls
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42749:34"/> Profeſſion of Truth, who hath not the Propoſition thereof by Faith faſtned unto his Soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Weaver</hi> divideth his warp, that it may ſerve ſeveral intendments. The deliberate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian divideth the Propoſitions of Truth of which his Soul is poſſeſſed.

Some inform him what GOD is, what CHRIST is, what He hath done and ſuffered, what the holy SPIRIT is, what Heaven and Hell are, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> others more immediately refer to Practice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Soul, what it ought to be both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD and towards Men. Theſe Precepts concern him as a Magiſtrate; This concerneth him as a Miniſter. Theſe things concern him as a Father, theſe as a Child, Theſe Propoſitions contain the Will of GOD concerning Him as an Husband; Theſe concern the Woman as a VVife. Theſe concern him as a Maſter; The other as a Subject, or as a Servant. And this is neceſſary that he may be <hi>Holy in all manner of Converſation.</hi> For Holineſs is a lovely ſpotleſs Fruit, that grows up from the <hi>revealed will of GOD</hi> concerning us, as the Root; and as this Root ſends forth many Branches, ſo the Fruit of Holineſs muſt be ſeen in every Bough, in every Relation and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Life.</p>

The Church indeed, yea the Civil Magiſtrate, may Determine, that nothing be Publiſhed within their Territories contrary to what they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the will of GOD: But certainly no Man can make an Hair of <hi>Truths</hi> Head, <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Black.</hi> Truth will be Truth, and Error a Lie when Men have ſaid what they can; nor is any particular Church more Infallible than <hi>a Pope.</hi> My follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Multitude in an Error will no more excuſe me than the following of a Multitude to do Evil.

                     <hi>Hear the Church</hi> Reverently, to Examine what it ſaith Diligently, and to believe it, as my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells me; it doth or doth not agree with the Holy Scriptures. Our Spiritual <hi>Weaver</hi> then may be aſſured that there are ſeveral Threeds Defective in his Warp; And therefore ſtands highly concerned to be ever and anon caſting an Eye upon it, Examining the Various Propoſitions which he hath embraced for Truth, and upon which he Buildeth and Directs his Practice. But it is very poſſible, that he may not be able to put in better Threeds when he hath done. He is a Bruit, no Man, that can Believe what he Liſteth, or whatſoever his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour would have him to Believe. All a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Duty in this Caſe is, 1. To Examine and Prove Propoſitions, to hear on both ſides, to compare Things Spiritual with Spiritual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. To have the Perſwaſions to himſelf, in which he hath Faith different from the Church in which he Lives. 3. To Beg of GOD to Lead him into all Truth, and to Reveal what as yet is not Revealed to him, and to Pardon his Miſtakes, and not to Conceal any Truth Revealed to him in Unrighteouſneſs. Which doing he may be aſſured <hi>we have an High-Priest can have Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our</hi> Infirmities, <hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Weaver</hi> finds many a Threed Break in the Striking, yet is his Web not ſpoiled by it; But when it Happens, he ſtops, looks back, and lays up, and Re-unites his Threeds, and goeth on in his work: Thus doing, though there be many a Real Breach, yet the piece comes off, is approved, Merchantable and paſſeth: we have before conſidered all the Thoughts, Words and Actions of a Chriſtians Life as our <hi>Spiritual Weavers Striking.</hi> Infinite are the Threeds that break in it. The Righteous ſinneth ſeven times in a day; who can tell how oft he offendeth? He who thinks he can keep the whole Law of GOD in Thought, Word and Deed, is not more to be blamed for his Error, than for his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: If he knew what Holineſs that Holy Rule requireth he would never ſay ſo. It was becauſe the Phariſees did not know that GODS Law which ſaith <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> forbade as well Raſh Anger and ill Words, as Bloody Actions; That they thought they could fulfill it; And if the <hi>Popiſh Doctors,</hi> did not give a Jejune Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of a Divine Law no way Concordant to Holy Writ, they would never tell us of a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of works of Supererogation, or that any hath Oyl enough in his Lamp for himſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42749:48"/> which was what the wiſe Virgins in the Parable denied. Our Threeds (the LORD Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them,) will break, and do break every day. What help in this Caſe, but to caſt our Eyes back upon our Actions; to take care <hi>ut ultima reſpondeant primis,</hi> to bring the Ends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again by <hi>Repentance,</hi> to make up the Breach by an Exerciſe of Faith on the LORD JESUS; to reſolve in GODS ſtrength to take more heed for the Future: This doing, though what is done cannot be undone, yet for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of CHRIST it ſhall be reckoned as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and our VVeb of Righteouſneſs accounted as perfect and accepted of GOD. The Soul is not made one who never ſinned, (That is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible and importeth a Contradiction) but it is made as one that had never ſinned, that is, its Sins ſhall never hurt it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Weaver when he hath</hi> wrought a <hi>Plate</hi> (ſo they call ſo much of the Web made as can at once lie before his Eye) <hi>he looks it over, picks it, Bruſheth off the looſe Knots, (ſo I think they</hi> call the little parts of Wooll or Yarn picked off) how fitly doth this prompt the Spiritual <hi>Weaver</hi> to his every day work of Self Examination? Every days thoughts, words, Actions make him a <hi>plate of Work.</hi> Some Unevenneſs there will be in it, his Conſcience Spiritually Enlightened, is the Inſtrument he muſt uſe to Pick his VVork by Something will be found too much, in his <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,

He never proves a good work-man, who is not as good and as Diligent at picking, as at throwing of his Shuttle. He never makes a good Chriſtian, who is not as good at Examining his ways, as walking in a ſeeming Courſe of Piety and Righteouſneſs. Often Reckoning we ſay makes long Friends: Often Reckoning with GOD and our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, will keep GOD and us long Friends, and our own Conſciences long Friends unto us. Oh that every good Chriſtian would Remember at the End of every day! My days work is now done but ſtill I have it to pick, and then retire into his Cloſet, and uſe his Conſcience to reflect upon his Actions, and ſee if it be (ſo far as his light will guide him) according to the Divine Rule; How much would this Contribute to the Evenneſs of a Chriſtians VVeb, and help him in the cloſe of his life to ſay after <hi>Hezekiah, LORD, Remember how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a Perfect Heart!</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. This whole work muſt be done till our piece comes quite off the Loom. Self-Examination, Repentance, Watchfulneſs, are not the works of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42749:49"/> a day, or a Month, or a Year, but of our whole Life; No work for <hi>Lent</hi> or <hi>Ember</hi>-weeks, or Faſting-days only, but the work of every day, every week: The good Chriſtian can never find a time for a <hi>Carnival.</hi> Travellers tell us, that in the Popiſh Countreys, particularly at <hi>Venice,</hi> the VVeek before their Mortifying time of <hi>Lent</hi> is called by that Name, a VVeek given up to all Manner of Luſt, Luxury, Gaming, Lewdneſs, and Prophaneneſs as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to their Mock-faſt that is to follow, which make their Lenton-weeks an undue Proportion of time for the Diſgorging their Polluted Souls of the Preceeding <hi>Crapula.</hi> Theſe are ill Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual <hi>VVeavers,</hi> that ſpoil more of their work in one week than they can again make good in many. The work-man in the LORDS work who needs not be aſhamed is quite another thing; He is alwayes at work either <hi>Weaving</hi> or Picking, either working or looking over, ſearching or proving what he hath done, whether it be good or well done, yea or no, till his piece comes off the Loom; His Hands and Eyes never ceaſe, and to him that doth thus, GOD will ſay, <hi>Well done!

Some ſpoil all, and have in ſtead of VVages Nothing but a ſmart Reproof and Chiding, or an Action brought againſt them; Others bring it Home ſlovenly done: Others bring it done well, and work man like. They are paid according to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42749:53"/> their work. The great <hi>Master,</hi> the LORD of Heaven and Earth, furniſheth every Man with Materials and Inſtruments, for him to do the work which he hath given him to do. None is without a <hi>Reaſonable Soul,</hi> endued with ſeveral Faculties (the Principles and Inſtruments of all Humane Operations.) All indeed have not alike wit, Capacity, Judgment, Reaſon; But all have ſome Materials, ſome Power's given to them. GOD (as the Prudent <hi>Weaver</hi>) doth not at firſt give out to all the beſt Materials. The Prudent <hi>Weaver</hi> firſt tries his Servant with Coarſer Yarn, than with Finer; Firſt with Woollen, then with Silk: If he works not the Coarſer firſt, well, his Maſter truſts him not with the Finer: If he works not his VVoollen Yarn well, his Maſter will not adventure Silk into his Hands. If he doth work the Coarſer well, his Maſter is not bound, (otherwiſe than he may be by a Promiſe or Covenant) to truſt him with his moſt Choiſe and Coſtly Materials. I muſt Confeſs I do much encline to think that in the day of Judgment, no Soul ſhall be Condemned for not doing that which it had not wherewithal to do: As a Man may Sin without the Law, ſo he may periſh without the Law, being judged without the Law. I can eaſily acquit the holy GOD of any Unrighteouſneſs, if in Man's Lapſed Eſtate, he ſhould Eternally Condemn a Soul, for not doing what in his preſent State he cannot do.

'Tis certain, that we all had in <hi>Adam</hi> a Power to do whatſoever in Innocency GOD required of Man in order to Salvation; If our Forefather ſpent what we ſhould have lived upon, it were very abſurd to ſay, GOD hath loſt his Right to Exact his Debt, becauſe we have loſt our Power to pay it. But I ſay, I ſee no need to inſiſt on this. GOD will find enough to Condemn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The meritorious cauſe of their Damnation (to whom GOD pleaſeth not to give Efficacious Grace) will be found, their abuſe or not uſe of their Common Grace. It is true, did Men uſe their Common Grace never ſo well, they could not by ſuch uſe of it earn Special Grace, (that is a ſacred VVind which bloweth where it liſteth;) The price of it is above all the Pearl, and Coral, and Rubies, and Diamonds of a Natural Mans work: But I do not think that in the day of Judgement we ſhall ſee the face of one Soul, who did what in him lay; Onely GOD was wanting to him in the Diſpenſations of Effectual Grace. The Sinner (let him think what he will to the Contrary) ſhall never lay his Damnation at GOD'S door. This great Maſter will give every one according to his work.

If mens Conſciences where not feared with an hot iron, upon what an uneaſy pillow would they lye down at Night when their Conſciences ſhould tell them, now I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42749:59"/> have been doing nothing this day, but ſerving mens luſts, and helping them on to their Eternal R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine and Deſtruction? How many are thus employed? The <hi>Weaver</hi> as to this may ſleep ſecure; and work ſecurely in the day-time, being aſſured, that he may comfortably abide in the Calling to which GOD hath called him; He may confidently beg GOD'S Bleſſing upon his Employment, and ſay, <hi>Proſper thou the work of our Hands upon us, O LORD, Proſper thou our Handy work.</hi> He whoſe Employment lieth in a meer Service of Pride, Luxulry and Wantonneſs cannot do ſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Second advantage of this Trade, is <hi>The little time that it giveth either Servant</hi> or <hi>Maſter,</hi> (but Servants eſpecially) <hi>for idleneſs. Idleneſs</hi> (eſpecially in Youth) is the ſource and fountain of almoſt all the Debauchery polluteth the world, and all the Baggary with which we abound, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> 10.18. <hi>By much Slothfulneſs the Building decayeth, and through idleneſs of the Hands the Building drops through.</hi> This (ſaith <hi>Ezekial</hi> 16.49.) <hi>was the iniquity of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> an active buſy thing, and muſt be ſet on work; if it be not kept in a conſtant good Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will moſt certainly employ it ſelf ill, and undoubtedly the Debauchery of moſt places owes it ſelf to the great Leiſure that Servants
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42749:60"/> have in Shops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Weaver</hi> can find no time to be Idle in, a bleſſed Employment which keeps the Soul out of the Temptations to which Idleneſs expoſeth it. Idle Perſons 1 Timothy 5.13. are <hi>not Idle only,</hi> but <hi>Tatlers,</hi> and <hi>Buſie-Bodies, wandring from Houſe to Houſe, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things which they ought not:</hi> Yea, and doing things too which they ought not. It is the idle Perſon that proves the <hi>Gameſter,</hi> the <hi>Drunkard, &amp;c.</hi> It is true there may be an Exceſs in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, when it is to that degree that it waſteth the Body, deſtroyeth the Health, allows not due time for Devotion, nor the reaſonable Repairs of the Body, by Food or Sleep, or moderate Recreation; but (theſe things excepted) the leſſer time for <hi>Idleneſs</hi> any Trade allows the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is. This I am ſure this Trade doth. I and many times Aſhamed of my own Bed, when I ſee the Candles in the poor <hi>Weavers</hi> Chambers, or hear the Noiſes of their Looms.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, It is the Advantage of this above many other Trades, that a Man may be dealing in it with a <hi>little Stock,</hi> and from it get a little Livelihood. It is the Diſadvantage of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Employments, that nothing can be done in them without ſeveral Hundreds of Pounds go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: 'tis otherwiſe in this, My ſelf have known many who came to conſiderable Eſtates, who have told me they begun with ten Pound; they paſſed but with a Staff over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and at their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42749:60"/> coming Back had Great Droves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, If GOD blaſts the <hi>Weaver</hi> in his Courſe of Trade, yet (provided he hath his Health and Limbs,) his Trade affords him a Livelihood. Many Trades do not this, they are more open, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if the Tradeſman fails, he is forced to fly.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If GOD bleſſeth the <hi>Weaver</hi> in his Trade, he is fitted by it alſo in a great meaſure for the more Noble Employment of a Merchant; He hath learned to know the true making and the prices of moſt Stuffs, how they may be afforded, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>It gives a great advantage,</hi> for ſome <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Religion</hi> to be interwoven with ſeculare Employments. It is the great unhappineſs of ſome Employments, that they ſo wholly take up the Head and Heart of ſuch as are Ingaged in them, that they hardly allow any intervals for any Spiritual Employment. The <hi>Weaver</hi> is not ſo; But his Trade is very conſiſtent with, 1. <hi>Heavenly Ejaculations:</hi> He may have <hi>manum</hi> in <hi>textrino oculos in coelo;</hi> his Employment will not hinder his devout Soul from many a look toward Heaven; he may <hi>VVeave</hi> and <hi>pray.</hi> 2. <hi>Spiritual Meditations:</hi> If not ſo continued and fixed, as if wholly at leiſure; yet frequent, and ſerious. My ſenſe of this hath given me the occaſion of helping him in the former part of this Diſcourſe. 3. <hi>Spiritual diſcourſe.</hi> Ordinarily three or four
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42749:61"/> are working here together in the ſame Chamber. If but one of them will be the Preacher, the others are tyed to be the hearers; and indeed I have often thought (how truly I cannot tell) that this Trade this way hath very much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Religion of this Town, GOD having a great number of that Occupation among us, of whom we have Reaſon to hope very well, as to their Eternal State.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is a Trade of great <hi>ingenuity:</hi> No mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Trade (if this may be called ſo) giving ſuch an advantage to Ingenious Perſons to <hi>Improve their fancy,</hi> by the invention of new Patterns, or mixing Yarn and Colours too for a new Pattern laid before them.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Laſtly, It is a Trade infinitely uſeful as to the Poor. Females both VVomen and Children are imployed in preparing their Yarn: Children from their Infancy almoſt, in winding their Pipes, Men in Weaving at the Loom. In ſhort I cannot tell whether there be any one other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that affords ſo many perſonal advantage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the Field:</hi> I am ſure the <hi>King of England</hi> is eminently ſerved by the <hi>Weaver;</hi> and this is obvious to any one who doth but conſider, what an innumerable company of Spinſters, Woolcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Filling-boys, Shearmen, Dyers, Preſſers,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42749:61"/> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> depend upon them: Beſides, the Merchant by them is ſerved with infinite variety of Stuffs to be tranſported into all the hotter parts of the world, beſides the great quantities uſed in our Land, and the Kings adjacent Dominions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Obſervation may be of a double uſe to the <hi>Weaver.</hi> 1. To <hi>Reſtrain his Diſcontent for the Courſe of Life,</hi> in which the Providence of GOD, the Prudence of his Parents or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and his own Choice in his Younger Years, have engaged him. It is a great infirmity of our Natures, that not one of many is content with his portion. The Poet long ſince complained of it:

Men wonder, ſome ſay ſuch a one was never a bad Husband, he ſcarce ever ſpent a penny at an Alehouſe. Inconſiderate Men that do not attend to that of Solomon; <hi>That he who is Slothful in his work,</hi> though he be not, yet he <hi>is Brother to a great Waſter.</hi> There is a waſte of Time as well as Silver, and the Drunkard loſeth much more by the loſs of the Tune he ſpends at the Alehouſe than of the Money which he there ſpends. The Sluggard that puts his Hand in his boſome never pulls it out full of Silver. The VVorld is a thing which will be attended, a Miſtreſs that can never be had without a Due Courting. Beſides, the idle Perſon always hath the Curſe of GOD at his heels: GOD hath ſaid, <hi>write this Man</hi> a begger, when he ſaid, <hi>In the Sweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat</hi> thy Bread; and the Apoſtle when he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>That thoſe that would not labour ſhould not eat,</hi> hath ſhut him out of good Chriſtians Charity, and forbade him the poor Mans basket. The idle Perſon is the only one for whom the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42749:73"/> bountiful GOD hath made no proviſion. GOD hath Provided a basket into which every good Man will put ſomething, for him that cannot live by his Hands. But for the idle Perſon GOD hath provided nothing, but a <hi>bridewell</hi> here, and an hell hereafter.</p>

                     </gap> Trade, is a noble Enquiry, and eſpecially for us who Live upon a Spot of Earth that is Incompaſſed with the Sea. VVhat-ever they may do that Live on a Continent, it is Certain that thoſe who Live in Iſlands (if they have not a Sufficiency within themſelves) cannot Live
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42749:84"/> without Trade: nor can any people without it Live happily. The people are very thin in any place, if they be not too many to be Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in meer Tilling the Ground, and making neceſſaries for one another who are Natives of the Place: ſo as either a great number muſt be Idle (which is the Bane of any Place) or they muſt be employed in providing for other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which have not what we have.

That it is the great Incentive, and Inſtrument of Humane Society; it makes all Mankind of one Body, and by mutual Entercourſe to ſerve the Occaſions, Supply the Needs and Miniſter to the Delight and Entertainment one of another. It enlargeth the Minds of Men, as well as their Fortunes; inſomuch that any Nation is Unpolite, Unbred, and half Barbarous without it. It inures Men to Hardſhip and Danger; it inſtructs them in Subtilty, and all the Arts of Self-ſecurity. It alſo adds much to the Beauty, Power, and Strengths

                        </gap> which the Law of GOD doth not expreſly require at their Hands.</hi> For amongſt the things that have been found the eminent Cauſes of the Ruine of Trade:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Perſecution of Men for their different Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions in the things of GOD,</hi> hath been ſo Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and Eminent, as all the VVorld hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> taken Notice of it. By <hi>Perſecution</hi> I mean a violent Proſecution of Men to the Loſs of their <hi>Lives, Liberties</hi> or <hi>Eſtates,</hi> let it be by the Execution of a Law or not.

This hath been ſo eminently proved by a worthy Hand that nothing need be added to it. Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> where <hi>Liberty</hi> is granted in the things of GOD, and thoſe Places where the Popiſh Inquiſitions take place, and compare the State of the one with the other, and there needs no further VVitneſs. VVhat brought the Trade both of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42749:85"/> this Place and ſome others in <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>D. Alva's</hi> Perſecution in <hi>Flanders?</hi> And I dare ſay this one thing ſhall to the End of the World be the Ruine of Trade any Place. The Power of Conſcience is exceeding great: beſides that in all Trading there muſt be ſuch an intermixing of Mens Eſtates, ſuch a dependency of the Well-being of one Man upon another, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily requires the Freedom and Security of all who are of any conſiderable Fortunes. In a Perſecution none knows who he may truſt his Eſtate with, nor how far he may adventure: in ſhort it Plucks up all Trade by the Roots; Diſpirits Men from dealing or adventuring, which makes Perſecution a thing, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Luſts of ſome Ill-natured, Peeviſh, Self-willed Men, yet, contrary to the true Intereſt of all Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Second Cauſe (is the Daughter of this Mother,) <hi>Transplantation,</hi> or <hi>Tranſmigration:</hi> this <hi>Perſecution</hi> cauſeth; Men will endure any thing rather than Oppreſſion in the Matters of their Conſcience. Thoſe who think, that <hi>Riches</hi> and a Courſe of Trade in a Place, will Stake Men down, and Nail them to their Poſts while they Scourge them according to their Malice, forget how many Thouſand Tradeſmen under <hi>Alva's Perſecution</hi> removed out of <hi>Flanders
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42749:86"/> into England,</hi> and how many Thouſands removed from <hi>Old</hi> into <hi>New England,</hi> deſpiſing their Native Countrey and all their Intereſts here, the Dangers of the Seas, the Difficulties they could not but foreſee of making a Deſolate VVilderneſs habitable: all theſe were nothing in their Eyes ſo they might keep a Conſcience void of Offence toward GOD in the Great Matter of his VVorſhip. <hi>Tranſplantation</hi> or <hi>Removal</hi> of Tradeſmen in any conſiderable Number from any Place where they were fixed, is ſo obvious a Cauſe of the Decay and Ruine of the Trade of that Place that it need not be enlarged upon; whoſo ſeeth it not is Blinder than a Beetle, and deſerveth to be begged, till he can tell the VVorld how the Channel can run as full when the VVater is let out into ſeveral Streams, as when it had but one Tract.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Cauſe of the <hi>Abatement of Trade,</hi> is the <hi>Multiplication of thoſe who are occupied in it.</hi> The VVorld is a finite thing, there is an Enough for it, and it hath but its meaſure to give: And as it is impoſſible that ſuppoſing a Father to have ten Sons, and another two, though they both have equal Eſtates, that they ſhould both give equal Portions to every Child; ſo neither can the World ſatisfy a Multitude of Beggars as well as if it had but a few. This Abatement of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42749:86"/> Trade is not in the General, but as to Particulars in the whole as much is gotten as ever; but few individuals get ſo much, nor is it poſſible they ſhould, unleſs we could imagine a proportionable Multiplication of Perſons in the World to be Fed or Clothed, to the effects of the multiplied Tradeſmen, who Work to Feed, Cloth and Adorn them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth Cauſe of the <hi>Decay of Trade,</hi> is the <hi>Falſe making of Commodities, and Mens Falſe Dealing one with another</hi> in Bargains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A thing for the repute of which we in <hi>England</hi> (how juſtly I know not) infinitely ſuffer beyond the Seas. Truth gives all things a Reputation: Falſehood is as conſtant a Blot, and will be the Ruine of that Man, or any number of Men that uſe it. It may (like VVine in a Feaver) ſeem a little to refreſh his Purſe at firſt, but it will empty it at laſt. The Reward of the Liar is when once known, never to be further truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A fifth Cauſe is <hi>Mens ſtudious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-ſelling one another.</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> told us long ſince, <hi>that the whole VVorld lies in VVickedneſs,</hi> and truly a great part of it lies in this piece of VVickedneſs, being ſtudious to out go one another: now though this be every one's Duty in that which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42749:87"/> is Good, and poſſibly Lawful, if duly circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, in things which are either Good or Evil as they are uſed; yet it may be ſo purſued as it may be very Evil.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly, I obſerve, that hardly any <hi>Trades,</hi> will maintain their Glory, without ſome Government; every particular Tradeſman, having neither VVit nor Honeſty enough to be a Law to himſelf. In all conſiderable Trades therefore prudent Stateſ-men have thought fit to make Corporations, where the multitude are under the Inſpection, Rule and Government of the moſt Experienced, VViſe, and Diſcreet, Men of that Occupation: and moſt Trades which to any conſiderable degree multiply Tradeſmen, either have ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, or in a ſhort time come to nothing for want of it.</p>
                  <p>Let me now come to make ſome Spiritual Reflections upon theſe Ordinary Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

I cannot but from hence firſt Obſerve the <hi>mighty Power of Conſcience,</hi> awakened to the fear of Sinning againſt GOD. <hi>Quid non mortalia pectora Cogit?</hi> Men of no Conſcience may make a Jeer of it, none knoweth the Power of it but he that Feeleth it. It turns
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42749:87"/> a Priſon into a <hi>Delectable Garden,</hi> a Scorching Flame into a Bed of Roſes; and no wonder that it doth ſo, for what is it, but GODS Vicegerent in the little VVorld of Man? GOD'S Interpreter to every Soul? It is a great misfortune to a Perſon if it be ſuborned, and gives in a falſe Verdict. No Man can act againſt it, though every one is not bound to act according to every precept, or dictate of it. The Power of its Regrets, and Reflections for Diſobedience, are ſuch as none can ſtand under, and therefore none is bound to Humour any in running the Hazzard of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The tenderneſs of GOD to the tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his People,</hi> is alſo as Obvious an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from hence. Men of the VVorld can think of nothing for them but Gaols and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wells. One while they are thinking to Jeer them out of their Conſciences by a Ballad, another-while to rail them out of them by a Foul Mouth, anon to Cudgel them out of them. GOD doth not ſo with them in his Providence. If they cannot have a Room in <hi>Flanders,</hi> he will provide for them in <hi>England;</hi> if they cannot have a reſting Place in <hi>Europe,</hi> he will provide them one in <hi>America,</hi> making for them a way in the VVilderneſs, and Hewing them out an hiding Place through the Rocks, and in a Deſart
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42749:88"/> Land; and the Nation, that will not be a quiet Habitation for them that fear him, GOD will Judge. If they will have no tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences in their Cities and Ports, they ſhall have no Trade; to tell them they ſhall have no Religion will not trouble them, it may be the Decay of their Riches and Trade will. Let the Conſcience be truly tender, fearing to ſin againſt GOD; and let the VVorld be as Cruel, as Hard-Hearted, as Bloody as it will, they will find they have a tender Father. Never any loſt any thing, nor ſhall loſe by being afraid to Sin againſt the LORD, that made them, that bought them with his Precious Blood. A Man indeed may fear too much, but there are few, very few that Err on that Hand; there are Thouſands more that fear too little. <hi>The Simple paſs on</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) and are Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. VVhat a Vaſt Difference their is, between the <hi>Earthly</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual Weaver?</hi> The Multiplication of Tradeſmen in the former, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and ſpoils the Profit of the Trade. <hi>I would all the LORDS People</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) were Prophets:</hi> durſt any Poor <hi>Weaver</hi> in this Town, ſay I would all the People in this City were <hi>Weavers?</hi> the reaſon is Obvious: The VVorld hath not Gold and Silver enough to give to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42749:88"/> every one. Hence is the ſcrambling for it and all the VVorlds Game is, <hi>Catch he, who Catch can.</hi> But GOD hath <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> enough to give to all that will Trade for Heaven, ſo as none by getting hinders another. The VVorld cannot receive all the <hi>Clothes</hi> and <hi>Stuffs,</hi> that would be made if a tenth part of the Men in it were <hi>Weavers:</hi> but all the Prayers and Praiſes, all the Homages and Exerciſes of Holineſs, which the World can bring forth, are too little for that GOD to whom they aſcend as an Homage. Who would not be in Love with that Trade that were not capable of being abated by Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Tradeſmen; and yet would moſt certainly bring in ſuch Profit as Eye hath not Seen, nor Ear Heard, nor can enter into the Heart of Man to Conceive? ſuch are the Things which GOD hath prepared for them that Love and Serve him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Again; doth <hi>falſe making of VVares,</hi> and falſe Dealing with <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomers, ruine the Trading of any Place?</hi> and what is it that Ruines the Spiritual Trade but the ſame thing? when the <hi>Power of Godlineſs,</hi> is turned into a Form, Religion into a meer Formality and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Shew and Appearance. VVhen Men Glory in Shew and not in Reality, when Men are falſe in their Acts of Devotion, and falſe in their
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42749:89"/> Converſation, GOD will deal with them no longer; but remove his Name and his Goſpel from them, to a People that will bring forth better Fruit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I Obſerve that in Trading every ones ſtudy is to get his <hi>VVork done Cheaper than another, and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſell his Neighbour.</hi> Have we not too much of this in the Spiritual Trade too? doth not the falſeneſs of our Hearts prompt us, to come off as Cheap with GOD as we can? <hi>long Sermons, long Prayers,</hi> are thought Needleſs. <hi>VVe</hi> would fain put off to GOD that which hath coſt us Nothing, and which indeed is little VVorth: but GOD hath Curſed him, that <hi>hath a Male in his Flock and bringeth unto him a Female.</hi> VVe are bound to Love, and Serve the LORD our GOD with all our Heart, and all our Soul, and all our Strength.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Laſtly I Obſerve, that in all Trades, when Tradeſmen multiply to any great Number, the Trade never thrives long without a prudent Regulation and Government, all Men having not (as I ſaid before) either VVit or Honeſty enough to be a Law to themſelves; nor doth the Trade thrive much, Unleſs the Governours, <hi>be diſcreetly Choſen.</hi> 2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs they juſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42749:89"/> their</hi> Truſt. To this purpoſe ordinarily ſuch Tradeſmen are left to chuſe their own Governours as being beſt acquainted with the Trade, and the Perſons that have moſt Skill in it, and have beſt approved their Honeſty in the Managery of it. <hi>In thoſe days</hi> (ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.1.) <hi>when the number of the Diſciples were multiplied, there aroſe a Murmuring of the Grecians againſt the Hebrews, becauſe their VVidows were neglected in the daily Miniſtrations.</hi> In Multitudes Corruptions will multiply. This made the Apoſtles turn them into a Corporation, authorizing them, to look out ſeven Men amongſt themſelves, whom they might ſet over that Affair. A Government is neceſſary in the Church, and Originally it choſe its own Officers. But let a Trade have what Governours it will, if either they know not their Office, or knowing it wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not upon it, or in pretence waiting upon it, yet act directly contrary to their Truſt, winking at Falſe Weights, or Meaſures, diſcouraging the Beſt Tradeſmen, encouraging the VVorſt and moſt Falſe, the Trade muſt neceſſarily be ruined. And thus it will be in the Church of GOD, that drive the Spiritual Trade. If either it hath no Officers and Government, or if it hath ſuch as know not their VVork and Duty of their Place; or though they know it, yet through Lazineſs,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42749:90"/> or, Greedineſs of filthy Lucre wait not on it Or, though in pretence they wait upon it, yet in very deed act directly contrary to their Truſt, ſmiting thoſe the Fear the LORD in ſtead of thoſe that Hate him, diſcouraging the beſt Profeſſors and Practitioners in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in ſtead of the open Enemies of Truth and Holineſs; the Spiritual Trade of that Place that hath ſuch a Curſe muſt neceſſarily abate, or at beſt go on but in Corners.</p>
